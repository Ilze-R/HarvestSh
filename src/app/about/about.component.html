      Harvest Share is a movement of like-minded people who relish and practice
      the value of living more sustainably.<br /><br />
      That could be anything from connecting to source eggs from the backyard
      down the road, collecting veggies from the next suburb, or sharing
      gardening equipment with neighbors. But we start with the first step -
      sharing the harvest, which, for some reason, the household is not able to
      consume themselves and would otherwise throw away. Besides that, here at
      Harvest Share, our mission revolves around helping individuals like you
      foster connections and enrich your local neighborhood. Our platform serves
      as the ideal meeting ground for like-minded people. Discover individuals
      who share your passions and interests, and engage in meaningful
      conversations within your community. Before you realize it, a warmer and
      friendlier neighborhood begins to flourish. These newfound connections
      unite you all through your shared love for delicious food, gardening, and
      the joy of resource sharing.
